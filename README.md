The provided code implements a web application for searching and displaying meal information using JavaScript and the MealDB API. It includes functions to create and display meal cards dynamically based on user input, with each card containing a meal's name and photo. When a user clicks on a meal card, detailed information about that meal, including its ingredients, is displayed. The code ensures a responsive user experience by updating the webpage dynamically with loading messages while fetching data and indicating when meal details are loaded. Additionally, it handles cases where no meal is found for the searched input, providing appropriate feedback to the user.
